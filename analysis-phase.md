The Analysis Phase in Software Development

1\. Definition and Importance



The analysis phase is the first major stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Its primary goal is to understand the problem, collect requirements, define scope, and ensure all stakeholders share a unified vision of the system to be built.



It establishes:



What the system must do



Who will use it



What constraints exist



What success looks like



Without proper analysis, development risks failure, scope creep, misalignment, and costly rework.



2\. Sub-Steps of the Analysis Phase

2.1 Requirements Elicitation



Collecting information from:



Users



Business owners



Managers



IT teams



External stakeholders



Methods include:



Interviews



Surveys



Observations



Document analysis



Prototypes



Workshops



2.2 Requirements Classification



Organizing requirements into:



Functional Requirements



Non-functional Requirements (performance, security, reliability, UX)



Business Requirements



System Requirements



2.3 Requirements Modeling



Visualizing system behavior and data flow using:



UML Diagrams (Use Case, Activity, Class)



Flowcharts



ER Diagrams



Wireframes / low-fidelity mockups



2.4 Requirements Validation



Confirming the requirements are:



Complete



Accurate



Consistent



Feasible



Testable



stakeholders must sign off before development begins.



3\. Deliverables of the Analysis Phase



A complete analysis phase produces:



✔ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)



Includes functional + non-functional requirements.



✔ Use Case Documentation



Detailed flows describing interactions with the system.



✔ UML Diagrams



Visual representations of behaviors and data.



✔ Scope Documentation



Defines boundaries of the system.



✔ Initial Backlog (Epics + User Stories)

✔ Acceptance Criteria



Ensures clarity and quality of future testing.



4\. Best Practices



Engage stakeholders early



Use diagrams instead of ambiguous text



Validate assumptions



Prioritize requirements



Create traceability between requirements \& features



5\. Common Challenges



Miscommunication



Unclear or vague requirements



Changing requirements



Lack of stakeholder availability



Over-specification stopping innovation
